		</h2>
		
		<p>
			16. We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics
			providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and

			17. Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related
			technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our
			Services, but Utopian does not link to or provide your actual Utopian
			account details to these advertising partners. This means that Utopian does
			not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Utopian
			cannot see advertisers’ cookies and advertisers will not see Utopian
			cookies.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Analytics Partners
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			18. We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze
			usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics
			partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique
			visitors to our Services.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			19. For more information about how you may control the collection and/or
			use of information for advertising and analytics purposes, please see “Your
			Choices.”
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Security
		</h2>

			loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
			destruction.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Children under 18
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			21. Although we welcome users from all walks of life, Utopian is not

			account.
		</p>
		
		<h2>

		</h2>
		
		<p>
			24. You may delete your account information at any time by logging into
			your account and following the steps under “Preferences.” When you delete
			your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and
			disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note,
			however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to
			deleting your account will still be visible to others, unless you delete
			such content. We may also retain certain information about you as required
			by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.

		<h2>

		<h2>

		</h2>
		
		<p>

			Google Analytics Opt-out), and we will provide, as needed, additional tools
			and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and
			how you can opt-out. You have the ability to opt out of having your web
			browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes. For more
		information about behavioral advertising, or to opt out, please visit    <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.

		<h2>
			Do Not Track
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			27. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in most
			web browsers. We support DNT in our Services. There is no accepted standard
			on how to respond to web browsers’ DNT signals. When you have DNT enabled,
			we may still use information collected for analytics and measurement
			purposes or to otherwise provide our Services (e.g., Utopian.io buttons),
			but we will not load any third-party trackers. You may, however, opt out of
			having information about you collected and used for behavioral advertising
			purposes, as described above.
		</p>
		
		<h2>

		</h2>
		
		<p>
			28. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by

			your account or your use of our Services.

			information in and to Italy and other countries, where you may not have the
			same rights as you do under local law.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			Changes
		</h2>

			31. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will
			let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If we make a
			change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will
			provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to
			steemouncements, the front page of the Services or sending you a
			notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you
			access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed
			about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your
			privacy. If you continue to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes
